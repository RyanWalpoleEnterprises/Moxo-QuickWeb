<h3 align=center>Build native desktop apps with no code</h3>
<p align=center>
Moxo QuickWeb Studio takes just a few text fields of information to build your application. If you don't want to, you don't have to write a single line of code to generate a fully functional native desktop experience for your website or web-app. If you choose the .NET project type, the most you'll have to do is open the project in Visual Studio to one-click build and run your application from there.

<h3 align=center>Works on all flavours of Windows</h3>
<p align=center>
Whether you're using the dotLX or .NET Framework project type, we guarantee that your application will run on Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and Windows 11 immediately. Thanks to the Microsoft Edge WebView2 technology, regardless of the version of Windows you're on, you're getting a modern web browser to power your application.

<h3 align=center>Develop with endless possibilities</h3>
<p align=center>
When targeting .NET, you will have a fully realised Visual Studio project. From here, you can use the power of C#, Windows Forms and the .NET Framework to extend your application, adding and customising features. Whether it be as simple as changing the typography or iconography, to something as advanced as adding push notifications - the world is your oyster.
